This project aims to contain everything you will ever need on your website:
- a homepage and several informational pages
- a very nice menu, with three or more layers and pictures
- user logon and authorisation & socialauth.
- forms, forms, forms in every variant you need
- a webshop: Speckcommerce
- a blog
- a forum
- webservices and apps
- ... other stuf that is very handy

This project is the opposite of the well-known skeleton. In contrast to the Skeleton, where you have to add all extra's 
you need, this project will give you everything possible and you have to strip out all you don't need.

Feel free to fork this and give me a pull-request to add some stuff that was still missingmissing or comments on what you think of it.
